I learned html and css from youtube channel "code with harry", his way of explaining html and css is very good.Harry sir made a playlist "Web development tutorials for beginners in hindi" on his channel on youtube, if anyone interested in learning web development from basics then anyone can access this playlist. I really appreciate his efforts for making this playlist.
